# Currency Converter

This is a simple currency converter application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to select currencies and convert amounts between them. This app was built as part of a friendly coding challenege among some friends.

## Note

**The API used for currency conversion is currently not working, so the application does not perform conversions at this time.**
